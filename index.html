                    <summary>Why "AmongBrown"?</summary>
                    So actually, the discord account I'm using right now is my alt,<br>
                    Long ago(not that long like on the movies), im using this account to evade something, im in a rush to change my profile before someone bans me,<br>
                    I remembered that i have some pictures of among us crewmates on my phone so im finding one.<br>
                    i was looking for a red crewmate first but I can't find it, found brown crewmate instead,<br>
                    i just combined "Among" and "Brown" so that's why "AmongBrown".
